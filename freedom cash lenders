Rapid approval timeline: The approval process for short-term loans is often very fast. You simply submit your application and proof of employment or other credit information.
The funds are provided quickly: Many short-term lenders deposit cash into your account in as little as 24 hours, which can be helpful if you have an emergency or unexpected expenses.
No collateral required: Unlike a secured loan, you do not provide collateral, such as a car or a home, to obtain a short-term loan.
Lower credit score requirements: The credit requirements associated with short-term loans are typically less stringent than other types of borrowing, making it easier to get approved.
