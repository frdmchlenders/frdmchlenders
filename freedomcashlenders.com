A short-term loan may be worth considering when you’re in a crunch and need cash quickly as they typically offer rapid funding. These types of loans can also be a good choice if you have poor credit or no credit history established, as the requirements for approval are primarily based on salary and other factors.

If you use a short-term loan responsibly, making payments on time and paying it off quickly, this form of borrowing can also be a tool to boost your credit score. Additionally, if you’re looking for a form of borrowing that allows you to be debt-free quickly, a short-term loan may be a good choice as the repayment timeline is typically 18 months or less.

However, you should only consider this form of borrowing if you’re confident you can repay the debt, as the interest rates on short-term loans are exorbitant, as high as 400 percent or more.
