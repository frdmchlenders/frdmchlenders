Payday loans: One of the most common is the payday loan, which provides cash for borrowers as they await their next paycheck. Usually, the only requirement is a pay stub to prove you have a job. These loans often require prompt payback — as soon as your next paycheck clears — and many come with enormous APRs and fees.
Car title loans: Another type of short-term lending, a car title loan, allows the borrower to use their vehicle as collateral as long as it’s owned outright. These loans usually allow you to borrow just 25 to 50 percent of the car’s market value and can come with APRs of 300 percent and repayment windows as short as 15 to 30 days. If you’re late with payments, the interest charges mount, and the loan will cost you far more.
